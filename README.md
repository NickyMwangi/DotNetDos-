# Understanding Dos and Dont's as a .Net Developer-

I use this repository to test new release feature when every .Net version is released. I test some of the dos and donts when working on a .Net projects most where performance is critical.

**Some of the testing you will find in the projects are;**

- To benchmark the performance when using ToArray(), ToList(), ToSet() and ToDictionary().
- Working with **ICollection<>(), ILIst<>() and IEnumerable<>()**.
- To benchmark the performance when using forEach(), for(), .Foreach(),While() and taskUntil().
- Web scrapping. That's reading data from a website without use of an AI.
- Implement the use of Min, Max, Sum and Average in an IEnumerable<>().

They have been tested using .Net 7.
